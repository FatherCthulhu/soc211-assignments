Article: Do Part-Time Students Benefit from College Promise Programs? Evidence from Cerritos Complete.
By Mary Rauner and Cameron Sublett, 2022

1. Methodology and Data Source

METHOD

Examine the degree to which students in the Cerritos Complete and the comparison group were descriptively similar or dissimilar. Doing this allows for authors to explore "baseline unconditional differences between Cerritos Complete students and the comparison group and to identify preliminary evidence of the relationship between Cerritos Complete participation and student outcomes" (Rauner and Sublett 2022: 7). This is a comparative analysis, looking at groups of CCC students, to assess if participation in the California College Promise Program is related to student outcomes.

Used a quasi-experimental methods of analysis called Coarsened Exact matching (CEM) (Rauner and Sublett 2022:11). This method is meant to "approximate random assignment by matching students on pre-treatment characteristics in the data" (2022:11).


DATA
Single cohort of first-time Cerritos College students over a four-year period, summer 2016 through summer 2020; also includes outcomes, demographic, and academic information for 3,165 students (514 student participants from Cerritos Complete program and 2,651 students who did not participate in Cerritos Complete with similar demographic and academic characteristics) (Rauner and Sublett 2022:5)

2. Unit of Analysis

OUTCOME MEASURES
Part-time and full-time enrollment. Credential completion

CONTROL MEASURES
Percentage of full-time enrollment
Fee waiver receipt
GPA
College English
College math
STEM major
Four-year transfer goal

3. Dealing with Missing Data

Multiple imputation used for: (Rauner and Sublett 2022:11)
- Restore missing observations
- Increase statistical power
- Reduce potential bias stemming from listwise deletion

4. What is Being Used from Resource
Will use part-time and full-time enrollment measurements, credential completion, percentage of full-time enrollment, and four-year transfer goal measures.
